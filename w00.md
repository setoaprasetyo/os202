# Top 10 List of Week 00

1. [GSGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google)<br>
A good way to find out how to properly do things is by doing GSGS (Google sana Google sini). It's a method of
searching and scanning through Google for answers.

2. [Process Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_management_(computing))<br>
In Operating Systems, there is a process manager which job is to find resources to processes, enable
processes to share and exchange information, protect the resources of each process from other processes and
enable synchronization with other processes.

3. [Memory Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management)<br>
In Operating Systems, there is a memory manager which task is to keep track of the locations of the memory,
moving processes in and out between main memory and disk during execution, and allocating memories to programs
that needs it.

4. [Storage/File System Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_management_system)<br>
In Operating Systems, there is a storage/file system manager which tasks include deleting and creating files,
opening and closing files when a task needs them, and specifying the access permission to read or write a file.

5. [Mass Storage Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_Resource_Manager)<br>
In Operating Systems, there is a mass storage manager which relates to the disk which is the secondary memory.
Its job is to schedule requests to the disk for a desirable efficiency, allocating memories in the disk, and also
freeing up space when its filled up.

6. [I/O Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I/O_request_packet)<br>
In Operating Systems, there is a I/O manager which handles buffering (holding data right before they're used),
caching (storing data so future requests for said data can be served faster), spooling (copying data between
devices), and interfacing (allowing users to enter and recieving information).

7. [Protecting and Security Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_management)<br>
In Operating Systems, there is a protecting and security manager which keeps omputer resources such as CPU,
softwares, memory, etc. secure and protected.

8. [Operating System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system)<br>
Operating Systems is a resource allocator and a control program. 

9. [Hypervisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor)<br>
To run a virtualization, a hypervisor is needed. There are multiple types of hypervisor, type 0, 1, and 2.

10. [Virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10)<br>
The virtualization method can be categorised based on how it mimics hardware to a guest operating system and
emulates guest operating environment: Paravirtualization, Emulators, and Containers.
