# Top 10 List of Week 09

1. [LFSC.ova](https://lfs.vlsm.org/)<br>
Checklist W09 requires a lot of downloading and decrypting tar files and also "time make"-s. some of them take a
ridiculously long amount of time that my laptop was lagging a bit. I'm not even fully sure what those files are going
to be used for.

2. [Storage](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/storage-structure-in-operating-systems/)<br>
Storage is needed when we want the programs and data to reside in main memory permanently. Secondary Storage is used as
an extension of main memory. Secondary storage devices can hold the data permanently.

3. [Storage Arrays](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/storage-array)<br>
Storage arrays are simply powerful computers which have large amounts of storage connected to them (granted there is
often some custom hardware in there). Storage arrays are configured in such a way that they can present storage to multiple
servers, typically over a dedicated network. Also called disk arrays, they are commonly used in business environments for
storage purposes and have excellent redundancy features to help protect data.

4. [BIOS (basic input/output system)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS)<br>
BIOS (basic input/output system) is the program a computer's microprocessor uses to start the computer system after it is
powered on. It also manages data flow between the computer's operating system (OS) and attached devices, such as the hard
disk, video adapter, keyboard, mouse and printer.

5. [Loader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loader_(computing))<br>
A loader is a major component of an operating system that ensures all necessary programs and libraries are loaded, which is
essential during the startup phase of running a program. It places the libraries and programs into the main memory in order
to prepare them for execution. Loading involves reading the contents of the executable file that contains the instructions of
the program and then doing other preparatory tasks that are required in order to prepare the executable for running, all of
which takes anywhere from a few seconds to minutes depending on the size of the program that needs to run.

6. [Systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd)<br>
Systemd is a software suite that provides an array of system components for Linux operating systems.
Its main aim is to unify service configuration and behavior across Linux distributions;[6] systemd's primary component is a
"system and service manager"—an init system used to bootstrap user space and manage user processes. It also provides replacements
for various daemons and utilities, including device management, login management, network connection management, and event logging.

7. [Storage Capacity](https://os.vlsm.org/Slides/os09.pdf)<br>
Over the time, various types of discs are created to store memories with different range of capacities. Some of them are:
Legacy 3.5” Floppy Disk (1.4MB)
  has another version called SuperDisk (up to 240 MB) but never really took off
4.7” Compact Disc (700MB)
  has another version called 4.7” Digital Versatile Disc (up to 9GB)
  and also 4.7” Blu Ray (up to 128 GB) that are used as DVDs
Tape Cartridge (up to 15TB)
  Robotic System (up to 250 PB per unit)
  NASA, Google, Microsoft are still using this
  ther are cheap but slow
HDD (Hard Disk Drives) (up to 16 TB)
  From Perpendicular Magnetic Recording to Shingled Magnetic Recording technology (+25% – writing problems).
  has Mechanical Disk Arm Scheduling
SSD (Solid-State Disks) (up to 16 TB)
 Generally pricier than HDD
 Has writting speed way faster than reading speed

8. [Boot Block](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/boot-block-in-operating-system/)<br>
A program at some fixed location on a hard disk, floppy disk or other media, which is loaded when the computer is turned
on or rebooted and which controls the next phase of loading the actual operating system. The loading and execution of the
boot block is usually controlled by firmware in ROM or PROM. Basically for a computer to start running to get an instance
when it is powered up or rebooted it need to have an initial program to run. And this initial program which is known as
bootstrap need to be simple. It must initialize all aspects of the system, from CPU registers to device controllers and
the contents of the main memory and then starts the operating system. 

9. [Disk Partition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_partitioning)<br>
Disk partitioning or disk slicing[1] is the creation of one or more regions on secondary storage, so that each region can
be managed separately.[2] These regions are called partitions. It is typically the first step of preparing a newly installed
disk, before any file system is created. The disk stores the information about the partitions' locations and sizes in an area
known as the partition table that the operating system reads before any other part of the disk.

10. [Firmware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware)<br>
Firmware is in a way an operating system, but much more restrictive and single-purposed because it is only for controlling
that device, whereas an OS is a general-purpose system that allows any kind of software to be run on multiple hardware devices.
