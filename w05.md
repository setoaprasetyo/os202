# Top 10 List of Week 05

1. [Logical and Physical Memory Separation](http://denninginstitute.com/modules/vm/green/defn.html)<br>
Virtual memory involves the separation of logical memory as perceived by users from physical memory. This
separation allows an extremely large virtual memory to be provided for programmers when only a smaller
physical memory is available.

2. [Demand Paging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_paging)<br>
In Operating Systems, demand paging is a method of virtual memory management. In a system that uses
demand paging, the operating system copies a disk page into physical memory only if an attempt is made
to access it and that page is not already in memory. 

3. [Page Fault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_fault)<br>
A page fault is a type of exception raised by computer hardware when a running program accesses a memory
page that is not currently mapped by the memory management unit into the virtual address space of a process.

4. [Demand Paging Performance](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gkesden/ucsd/classes/sp16/cse120-a/applications/ln/lecture13.html)<br>
The performance of demand paging is often measured in terms of the effective access time. Effective
access time is the amount of time it takes to access memory, if the cost of page faults are amortized
over all memory accesses. In some sense it is an average or expected access time.

5. [COW (Copy On Write)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write)<br>
COW (Copy On Write), sometimes referred to as implicit sharing or shadowing, is a resource-management
technique used in computer programming to efficiently implement a "duplicate" or "copy" operation on
modifiable resources. 

6. [Page Replacement Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_replacement_algorithm)<br>
In a computer operating system that uses paging for virtual memory management, page replacement algorithms
decide which memory pages to page out, sometimes called swap out, or write to disk, when a page of memory
needs to be allocated.

7. [Page-Buffering Algorithms](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_virtual_memory.htm)<br>
The operating system maintains a pool of free frames. When a page fault occurs, a page isselected for
replacement and written into the pool of free frames. The faulty page is swapped outof disk and the page
table is modified.

8. [Allocation of Frames](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocation-frames/)<br>
An important aspect of operating systems, virtual memory is implemented using demand paging. Demand paging
necessitates the development of a page-replacement algorithm and a frame allocation algorithm. Frame allocation
algorithms are used if you have multiple processes; it helps decide how many frames to allocate to each process.

9. [Thrashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrashing_(computer_science))<br>
In computer science, thrashing occurs when a computer's virtual memory resources are overused, leading to a
constant state of paging and page faults, inhibiting most application-level processing. This causes the
performance of the computer to degrade or collapse.

10. [This Week's Checklist](https://os.vlsm.org/Slides/os05.pdf)<br>
The Checklists of this week and previous weeks are all related to running "chktoken *some word*" and downloading
and decrypting tar.bz2.asc files and then putting the result to txt files. I don't really know what's that about
or why, but it keeps me wondering what that is preparing us for.
