# Top 10 List of Week 03

1. [File Concept](https://notesformsc.org/file-concepts/)<br>
A file is a named collection of related information that is recorded on secondary storage. In an OS, to
a user, the file is the smallest unit of storage on a computer system. The computer store information into
a storage media, such as disk, and optical drives. The user then performs file operations like read and
write. After that, the information stored in files are non-volatile. There types of files such as a text
file, image file, source file, executable file, and etc. These files have attributes, like names, type,
and size. The user usually edits the name as it is easier for users to recognize said file.

2. [Tar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing))<br>
Tar merupakan singkatan dari Tape archive dan digunakan untuk mengompres serangkaian file dan folder.
Umumnya, file yang telah dicompress dengan menggunakan command tar akan tersimpan dalam bentuk file .tar.
Kompresi selanjutnya yang menggunakan gzip akan menghasilkan file dalam format .tar.gz. Dengan menggunakan
Linux tar, Anda dapat meng-compress dan decompress file.

3. [VFS (Virtual File System)](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_aix_71/kernelextension/virtual_fsys.html)<br>
The virtual file system (VFS) interface, also known as the v-node interface, provides a bridge between the
physical and logical file systems. The purpose of a VFS is to allow client applications to access different
types of concrete file systems in a uniform way. A VFS can, for example, be used to access local and network
storage devices transparently without the client application noticing the difference.

4. [FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace)](https://wikimili.com/en/Filesystem_in_Userspace)<br>
FUSE lets us create our own file systems without editing kernel code. Non-priveleged and priveleged
users can achieve this by running file system code in user space while the FUSE module provides only a
“bridge” to the actual kernel interfaces. FUSE is a free software available for LINUX, macOS, and etc.

5. [Disk Partitioning](https://www.howtogeek.com/184659/beginner-geek-hard-disk-partitions-explained/)<br>
Disk partitions are more or less what their name says they are: turning one disk and splitting off its
storage space into partitions. Each partition is treated as one file system, or volume. This comes in
handy when you want to secure one volume from another via encryption, or use one partition with a certain
file system and another partition with another.

6. [Make](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/umake.htm)<br>
Make is a utility used for building and maintaining groups of programs from source code. In this week’s
demo, I got to try the make command on a file which I extracted from a tarball. This make utility also
determines which pieces of the program need to be recompiled, and tells the system to do so.

7. [NFS (Network File System)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system/)<br>
Network file System which is a mechanism for storing files on a network. NFS distributes file system that
allows users to access files and directories located on remote computers and treat those files and
directories as if they were local. Users may use operating system commands to create, remove, read, write,
and set file attributes for remote files and directories.

8. [File Allocation Methods](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-allocation-methods/)<br>
The allocation methods define how the files are stored in the disk blocks. There are three main disk space
or file allocation methods: Contiguous Allocation, Linked Allocation, Indexed Allocation. The main idea
behind these methods is to provide: Efficient disk space utilization, Fast access to the file blocks.

9. [Linux File System](https://likegeeks.com/linux-file-system/)<br>
Linux File System or any file system generally is a layer that is under the operating system that handles
the positioning of your data on the storage; without it, the system cannot knows which file starts from
where and ends where.

10. [Directory Implementation](https://padakuu.com/article/93-directory-implementation)<br>
The selection of directory-allocation and directory-management algorithms significantly affects the
efficiency, performance, and reliability of the file system. Directory implementation algorithms are
classified according to the data structure used. There are two algorithms that are commonly used: Linear
List and Hash Table.
